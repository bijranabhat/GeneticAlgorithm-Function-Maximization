Genetic AlgorithmsGenetic Algorithms:This project involves writing a genetic algorithm to find the maximum value of arbitrary functions. This problem involves attempts to calculate functions with hundreds of variables. We probably won’t be working with functions quite that size, but the effect will be the same.Functional Representation:The functions is represented in text files. The text files detail the coefficients of various terms in a very particular way. The text file begins with a line with a single number. That number represents how many variables are in the function. Assume that each variable is called xk. Each variable is assumed to be an integer with a value ranging from 0 to 255 (represented as eight bits in our individuals).After that line is  a blank line. Assume that the number appearing first in the file is N. Then will come N + 1 lines, each containing N + 1 integers. These numbers are given such that the item in row i and column j represents the coefficient of the term xixj. There are N + 1 rows and columns because row/column 0 represents the value 1.For example, consider this text file:31 2 3 42 5 6 73 6 8 94 7 9 10The 3 at the beginning tells us there are three variables, which we will call x1, x2, and x3. 
The grid can be interpreted like this:1x1x2x311234x12567x23689x347910The variables on the left are multiplied by the variables along the top, then by the coefficient in the grid. Thus, the expression that this file represents is:1 + 2x1 + 3x2 + 4x3 + 5x12 + 6x1x2 + 7x1x3 + 8x22 + 9x2x3 + 10x32Note that the grid is symmetrical, because x1x2 is the same as x2x1. You should not count the coefficients twice. The yellow cells are the ones that are needed. Your code should handle any number of variables (I think a max of 100 would be reasonable, if you need a hard limit).The Program:Your program does the following:* Prompts the user to enter a file name.* Opens the file and read in the information about the function. If the file doesn’t exist, it prints an appropriate error message and exit the program.* Runs a genetic algorithm to find the set of variables that maximizes the function.* When the program is finished, print the best set of variables found, and the value of the function with those variables.It is a genetic algorithm, though – using a population of candidate solutions, performing selection, cross-over, and mutation, etc. This algorithm may not find the absolute best solution (in fact, for larger problems it almost certainly will not), but it definitely “makes progress” towards a solution.Bijay Ranabhat
